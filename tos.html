<h3>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h3>

<p>
Welcome to Schmiede.ca! Schmiede.ca provides its service to you subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES. Schmiede reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify the Agreement or Service (as defined below) or Content (as defined below) at any time by posting a notice on the Site, or by sending you a notice via email or postal mail. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: http://www.Schmiede.ca/page/termsofuse .
</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h3>

<p>
Schmiede.ca provides users with access to a collection of resources (the "Service"). You understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Schmiede.ca to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Schmiede.ca, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Schmiede.ca Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Schmiede.ca membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Schmiede.ca assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. Schmiede.ca may change, suspend or discontinue the Service including any content for any reason, at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or content. Schmiede.ca may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict the User's access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.
</p>

<p>
In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Schmiede.ca has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Schmiede.ca has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). The User also certifies that it is legally permitted to use the Services and access the Site, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Site. Without limiting the foregoing, if User is under the age of 13, User is not allowed to use the Services. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Site is revoked in such jurisdictions.
