  testimonial: I was impressed by the intensity of the Schmiede participants as I watched them work on their projects. Clearly this was a very serious and committed group of artists. But, the most impressive thing about Schmiede was the atmosphere of sharing, generosity, creativity and craftsmanship that surrounded me.
