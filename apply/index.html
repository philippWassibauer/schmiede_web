    <p>
      Schmiede is a cooperative producers festival between the arts and entrepreneurship a playground where our ideas come to play.
      Schmiede is based on three principles: Network, Create, Present.
    </p>

    <p>
    We believe that in order to experience, refine and
    improve our model of reality (or work, or personal development)
    interacting, doing and producing, in the best case together,
    is of the essence. Therefore we, the Smiths, physically meet for
    ten days in order to get inspired, network, create, present,
    exchange, do, fail fast and learn to move forward.
     For this to happen Schmiede provides a basic cooperative
      prototyping environment. The objective is to learn from the
      process, each other, build trust and find collaborators
      the current or future projects. Schmiede does not teach.
      Schmiede provides inspiration and possibilities.
